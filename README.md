IAEA Intercomparison of PIGE analysis codes

PIGECodes-I: bulk analysis, 2018

The first IAEA inter-comparison of PIGE analysis codes was performed in 2018 and focused on 
calculations of bulk sample yields.

A set of four exercises was defined to test the performance of the codes on bulk analysis, starting from smooth cross sections and simple elemental compositions, and 
then extending to cross sections with structure and finally including effects such as beam energy spread and straggling. 

Four codes participated: 
ERYA (Lisbon), NDF (Lisbon), PIGRECO (Athens), SIMNRA (Garching) 

The exercises and conclusions were published in Barradas et al., NIMB 468 (2020) 37.
The numerical results of the inter-comparison are found in PIGE-I-intercomparison.xlsx
The individual code results are included in the codes folders.

PIGECodes-II: depth profiling, 2024

The second IAEA inter-comparsion of PIGE analysis codes was performed in 2024 and focused on multi-layer analysis using thin resonances, i.e. depth profiling.

Seven exercises were defined to investigate how the codes perform in simulations of: one thin film plus substrate (substrate can be heavy or light element)
two to three films plus substrate (substrate can be heavy or light element) with the following conditions: cross sections (i) varying smoothly with E and (ii) with sharp resonances – using a fictitious sharp resonance;
(a) full beam straggling (model to be determined in exercises) and (b) Gaussian-type spread different film thickness (surface, deep, very deep); stopping powers from SRIM2013.
 
Four codes participated in the inter-comparison: 
ERYA-profiling (Lisbon), NDF (Lisbon), SIMNRA (Garching), SPACES (Paris). 

The numerical results of the inter-comparison are included in folder PIGE-II-intercomparison.
The individual code results are included in the codes folders.
The exercise will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
